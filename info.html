                                    <p>In the early twentieth century, there were about 100,000 
                                        tigers in the wild with 9 subspecies. Now, that number is 
                                        3,900 and about 5,000 tigers are in captive populations.</p>

                                    <p>The demand for tiger parts has led to the development of deeply 
                                        inhumane places such as tiger breeding farms, which actively 
                                        breed and slaughter tigers for their parts. The farms were created 
                                        with the hopes of dissuading poachers from hunting wild tigers, 
                                        but some of these farms have only increased the illegal trade.</p>

                                    <p>Tigers are large animals that require a lot of land to roam and hunt. 
                                        They require tall grasses and vegetation to hide in. Tigers, like all 
                                        animals, need a reliable water and food supply. When these are taken 
                                        away, tigers cannot survive.</p>
